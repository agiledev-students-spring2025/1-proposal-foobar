# Project Proposal: Music Sharing App

# What and Why?

An app where people can create a profile to share their favorite songs, music preferences, etc. It creates a platform for people to find new music and connect with others who share similar music preferences. Similar to Letterboxd where people share their favorite movies.

# For Whom?

Any users ranging from casual listeners who want to find new music, to audiophiles who want to share their music opinions.

# How?

New users sign up, create a profile, and start logging their music, listing what they have listened to, as well as rate and review their own libraries.

# Scope

The project involves setting up a database for users, an interface for users to sign up, create a profile, etc, list their favorite songs, and delete their profile or songs. More advanced features can be created if the scope is too small, such as allowing users to follow others, rank each othersâ€™ libraries, etc.
